# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz



# Polymorphism
 
1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?
Answer: Polymorphism means many forms.
 
 
2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
 
Answer: Applying polymorphism to OO design means that a Class in Java may exist in different forms. A child Class may take on the data type of its parent class, whilst also appearing as its primary type.
 
3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

Answer: We can create and implement interfaces so that a class may take on the data type of the interface.  We can also use abstract classes.
 
4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

Answer: It can take multiple forms when using polymorphism - poly means many, so the clue is in the name.
 
5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

Answer: When you implement interfaces.
 
 
 
# Composition and Aggregation
 
6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
Answer: In composition, an object is a part of another object; this is described as a HAS-A relationship.  
 
7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
 
8. Give a difference between composition and aggregation? 
Answer: In aggregation, objects can exist independently from the object which contains them.  In composition, objects that are contained within another object, do not exist independently, and are destroyed when the main object is destroyed.
 
9. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition/aggregation?
Answer: Composition/aggregation allow you to give your objects the behaviours they need without getting tangled up the way that they would if they used only inheritance.
 
 
 
10. When using composition, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

Answer: all the objects it is composed of are destroyed too.
 
11. When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

Answer: all the objects it is composed of continue to exist independently of the object.
